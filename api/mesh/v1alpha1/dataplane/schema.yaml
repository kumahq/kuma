          `networking.address` for health checking systems to be able to check the
          state of Envoy. The rest of the endpoints exposed on `networking.address`
          are always protected by mTLS and only meant to be consumed internally by

      advertisedAddress:

          In some situations, a data plane proxy resides in a private network (e.g.
          Docker) and is not reachable via `address` to other data plane proxies.
          `advertisedAddress` is configured with a routable address for such data
          plane proxy so that other proxies in the mesh can connect to it over
          `advertisedAddress` and not via address.

          Envoy still binds to the `address`, not `advertisedAddress`.

              Type of gateway this data plane proxy manages.
              There are two types: `DELEGATED` and `BUILTIN`. Defaults to
              `DELEGATED`.

              A `DELEGATED` gateway is an independently deployed proxy (e.g., Kong,
              Contour, etc) that receives inbound traffic that is not proxied by
              Kuma, and it sends outbound traffic into the data plane proxy.

              The `BUILTIN` gateway type causes the data plane proxy itself to be
              configured as a gateway.

              See https://kuma.io/docs/latest/explore/gateway/ for more information.

                Health describes the status of an inbound.
                If 'health' is nil we consider data plane proxy as healthy.
                Unhealthy data plane proxies are excluded from Endpoints Discovery
                Service (EDS). On Kubernetes, it is filled automatically by the control
                plane if Pod has readiness probe configured. On Universal, it can be
                set by the external health checking system, but the most common way is
                to use service probes.

                check the application next to it and report the status to the control
