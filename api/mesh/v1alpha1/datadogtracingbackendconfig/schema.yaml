            Determines if datadog service name should be split based on traffic
            direction and destination. For example, with `splitService: true` and a
            `backend` service that communicates with a couple of databases, you would
            get service names like `backend_INBOUND`, `backend_OUTBOUND_db1`, and
            `backend_OUTBOUND_db2` in Datadog. Default: false
          type: boolean
