                      Tags specifies a unique combination of tags that routes can use
                      to match themselves to this listener.

                      When matching routes to listeners, the control plane constructs a
                      set of matching tags for each listener by forming the union of the
                      gateway tags and the listener tags. A route will be attached to the
                      listener if all of the route's tags are preset in the matching tags

                          Certificates is an array of datasources that contain TLS
                          certificates and private keys.  Each datasource must contain a
                          sequence of PEM-encoded objects. The server certificate and private
                          key are required, but additional certificates are allowed and will
                          be added to the certificate chain.  The server certificate must
                          be the first certificate in the datasource.

                          When multiple certificate datasources are configured, they must have
                          different key types. In practice, this means that one datasource
                          should contain an RSA key and certificate, and the other an
                          ECDSA key and certificate.
