                                StreamIdleTimeout is the amount of time that proxy will allow a stream to exist with no activity.
                                Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it. Default is 30m

                            IdleTimeout is defined as the period in which there are no bytes sent or received on connection
                            Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it. Be cautious when disabling it because
                            it can lead to connection leaking. Default value is 1h.
