description: "Workload represents a logical grouping of data plane proxies in the mesh, providing visibility into their operational status. It tracks statistics about the data plane proxies that belong to a workload, including the number of connected, healthy, and total proxies, enabling monitoring and health assessment of your workload deployments. Workloads is also the primary way data-planes are grouped together in metrics and traces."
