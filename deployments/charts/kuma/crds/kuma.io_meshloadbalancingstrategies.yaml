                                    an absolute guarantee. Minimal disruption means
                                    that when the set of upstream hosts change, a
                                    connection will likely be sent to the same upstream
                                    as it was before. Increasing the table size reduces
                                    the amount of disruption. The table size must
                                    be prime number limited to 5000011. If it is not

                                host clockwise around the ring.

                                          load balanced to tag is computed by dividing
                                          weight by sum of weights from all tags.
                                          For example with two affinity tags first
                                          with weight 80 and second with weight 20,
                                          then 80% of traffic will be redirected to
                                          the first tag, and 20% of traffic will be
                                          redirected to second one. Setting weights
                                          is not mandatory. When weights are not set
                                          control plane will compute default weight
                                          based on list order. Default: If you do
                                          not specify weight we will adjust them so
                                          that 90% traffic goes to first tag, 9% to
                                          next, and 1% to third and so on.'
