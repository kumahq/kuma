                            IPMode specifies how the load-balancer IP behaves, and may only be specified when the ip field is specified.
                            Setting this to "VIP" indicates that traffic is delivered to the node with
                            the destination set to the load-balancer's IP and port.
                            Setting this to "Proxy" indicates that traffic is delivered to the node or pod with
                            the destination set to the node's IP and node port or the pod's IP and port.
                            Service implementations may use this information to adjust traffic routing.
