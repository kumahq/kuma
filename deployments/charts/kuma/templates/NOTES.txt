{{ .Chart.Name }} has been installed!

Your release is named '{{ .Release.Name }}'.

You can access the control-plane via either the GUI, kubectl, the HTTP API, or the kumactl CLI.
{{- if .Values.noHelmHooks }}

 WARNING

    When the "noHelmHooks" value is provided, you will need to manually delete
    the "ValidatingWebhookConfiguration" responsible for validating {{ include "kuma.name" . }} resources
    before you can uninstall Helm release. This is because the validation provided
    by the webhook is not necessary during the release removal and might potentially
    even prevent you from doing it. You can do this by running the following command:

    kubectl delete ValidatingWebhookConfiguration {{ include "kuma.name" . }}-validating-webhook-configuration

 WARNING

    When the "noHelmHooks" value is set, Helm will not automatically update
    the CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) when upgrading release. You must manually
    update the CRDs if the new {{ include "kuma.name" . }} version has changes
    to the CRDs. You can achieve this by calling the following command:

    kumactl install crds --no-config{{ if .Values.experimental.gatewayAPI }} --experimental-gatewayapi{{ end }} | kubectl apply -f

{{- if and .Values.experimental.ebpf.enabled (not .Values.cni.enabled) }}

 WARNING

    When the "noHelmHooks" value is set, Helm will not automatically uninstall
    the eBPF resources. You will need to manually uninstall these resources after
    uninstalling Helm release. To do this, run the following command:

    kumactl uninstall ebpf --cleanup-image-registry {{ .Values.global.image.registry }} --cleanup-image-repository {{ .Values.dataPlane.initImage.repository }}

{{- end }}
