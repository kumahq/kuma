The Kuma Control Plane has been installed!

You can access the control-plane via either the GUI, kubectl, the HTTP API, or the kumactl CLI.

Kuma ships with a read-only GUI, exposed on port 5683, that you can use to retrieve Kuma resources.

To access Kuma we need to first port-forward the GUI service with:

  kubectl port-forward -n {{.Release.Namespace}} svc/{{ include "kuma-cp.serviceName" . }} 5683:5683
