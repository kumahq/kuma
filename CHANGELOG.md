Breaking changes:
* ⚠️ Mesh can now have multiple CAs of the same type. Also it can use CA loaded as a plugins. For migration details, please refer to [UPGRADE.md](UPGRADE.md)

* ⚠️ before the change TrafficPermission worked in cumulative way, which means that all policies that matched a connection were applied.
  We changed TrafficPermission to work like every other policy so only "the most specific" matching policy is chosen.
  Consult [docs](https://kuma.io/docs/0.4.0/policies/how-kuma-chooses-the-right-policy-to-apply/) to learn more how Kuma picks the right policy.

## [0.3.2]

> Released on 2020/01/10

A new `Kuma` release that brings in many highly-requested features:

* **support for ingress traffic into the service mesh** - it is now possible to re-use
  existing, feature-rich `API Gateway` solutions at the front doors of
  your service mesh.
  E.g., check out our [instructions](https://kuma.io/docs/0.3.2/documentation/#gateway) how to leverage `Kuma` and [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong) together. Or, if you're a hands-on kind of person, play with our demos for [kubernetes](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-demo/tree/master/kubernetes) and [universal](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-demo/tree/master/vagrant).
* **access to Prometheus metrics collected by individual dataplanes** (Envoys) -
  as a user, you only need to enable `Prometheus` metrics as part of your `Mesh` policy,
  and that's it - every dataplane (Envoy) will automatically make its metrics available for scraping. Read more about it in the [docs](https://kuma.io/docs/0.3.2/policies/#traffic-metrics).
* **native integration with Prometheus auto-discovery** - be it `kubernetes` or `universal` (😮), `Prometheus` will automatically find all dataplanes in your mesh and scrape metrics out of them. Sounds interesting? See our [docs](https://kuma.io/docs/0.3.2/policies/#traffic-metrics) and play with our demos for [kubernetes](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-demo/tree/master/kubernetes) and [universal](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-demo/tree/master/vagrant).
* **brand new Kuma GUI** - following the very first preview release, `Kuma GUI` have been significantly overhauled to include more features, like support for every Kuma policy. Read more about it in the [docs](https://kuma.io/docs/0.3.2/documentation/#gui), see it live as part of our demos for [kubernetes](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-demo/tree/master/kubernetes) and [universal](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-demo/tree/master/vagrant).
