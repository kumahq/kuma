* Documentation: https://kuma.io/docs
* Slack Chat: https://kuma.io/community

DEPLOYMENTS:

Kuma supports both standalone and multi-zone deployments. To learn more:

* Standalone: https://kuma.io/docs/latest/deployments/stand-alone
* Multi-Zone: https://kuma.io/docs/latest/deployments/multi-zone

GETTING STARTED:

To get started and read the quickstart, follow the instructions for your 
distribution at: https://kuma.io/install

While we support different installation methods for both Kubernetes, VMs and 
other containerized environments, you can also follow these simple commands to 
get up and running quickly:

KUBERNETES (Standalone):

If you are installing Kuma on Kubernetes, run the following command:

$ kumactl install control-plane | kubectl apply -f -

UNIVERSAL (Standalone):

If you are installing Kuma on other platforms (including VMs or other
containerized environments), just run:

$ kuma-cp run

In Universal mode Kuma runs with the in-memory backend by default. 
To use Postgres instead please read the docs:

* https://kuma.io/docs/latest/documentation/backends/

NEXT STEPS:

You can now explore the Kuma GUI on `http://localhost:5681/gui`!

Finally, you can start using Kuma by apply traffic policies to any service 
running in your system:
