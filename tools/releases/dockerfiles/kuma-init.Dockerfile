# As of iptables 1.8, the iptables command line clients come in two different versions/modes:
# "legacy", which uses the kernel iptables API just like iptables 1.6 and earlier did, and
# "nft", which translates the iptables command-line API into the kernel nftables API.
#
# Because they connect to two different subsystems in the kernel, you cannot mix and match
# between them; in particular, if you are adding a new rule that needs to run either before
# or after some existing rules (such as the system firewall rules), then you need to create
# your rule with the same iptables mode as the other rules were created with, since otherwise
# the ordering may not be what you expect. (eg, if you prepend a rule using the nft-based
# client, it will still run after all rules that were added with the legacy iptables client.)
#
# In particular, this means that if you create a container image that will make changes to
# iptables rules in the host network namespace, and you want that container to be able to work
# on any host, then you need to figure out at run time which mode the host is using, and then
# also use that mode yourself. This wrapper is designed to do that for you.
