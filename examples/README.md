# Kuma Demo Application

## Introduction
[![][diagram]][diagram]

The Kuma Demo Application is a microservice driven marketplace where you can browse clothing items and reviews left by users. This open-source application can be run alongside Kuma to demonstrate all of Kuma's capabilities in a real-world scenario. The source code can be found on the [`kuma-demo`](https://github.com/Kong/kuma-demo/) repository.

Since Kuma can run and be operated natively across both Kubernetes and VM environments, we maintain two how-to guides to help you understand Kuma in each environment:
