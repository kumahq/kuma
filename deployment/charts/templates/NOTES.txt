Kuma has been installed, you can access the control-plane via either the GUI, kubectl, the HTTP API, or the CLI

Kuma ships with a read-only GUI that you can use to retrieve Kuma resources. By default the GUI listens on port 5683.

To access Kuma we need to first port-forward the GUI service with:

$ kubectl port-forward svc/kuma-control-plane -n 5683:5683
