                            The "no traffic interval" is a special health check interval that is used
                            when a cluster has never had traffic routed to it. This lower interval
                            allows cluster information to be kept up to date, without sending a
                            potentially large amount of active health checking traffic for no reason.
                            Once a cluster has been used for traffic routing, Envoy will shift back
                            to using the standard health check interval that is defined. Note that
                            this interval takes precedence over any other. The default value for "no
                            traffic interval" is 60 seconds.
