## MeshGatewayRoute

- `selectors` (required, repeated)

    Selectors is used to match this resource to MeshGateway listener.    
    
    - `match` (optional)
    
        Tags to match, can be used for both source and destinations

- `conf` (required)

    Conf specifies the route configuration.    
    
    - `tcp` (optional)    
        
        - `rules` (required, repeated)    
            
            - `backends` (required, repeated)    
                
                - `weight` (required)
                
                    Weight is the proportion of requests this backend will receive
                    when a forwarding rules specifies multiple backends. Traffic
                    weight is computed as "weight/sum(all weights)".
                    
                    A weight of 0 means that the destination will be ignored.    
                
                - `destination` (required)
                
                    Destination is a selector to match the individual endpoints to
                    which the gateway will forward.    
    
    - `http` (optional)    
        
        - `hostnames` (optional, repeated)
        
            Hostnames lists the server names for which this route is valid. The
            hostnames are matched against the TLS Server Name Indication extension
            if this is a TLS session. They are also matched against the HTTP host
            (authority) header in the client's HTTP request.    
        
        - `rules` (required, repeated)
        
            Rules specifies how the gateway should match and process HTTP requests.    
            
            - `matches` (required, repeated)
            
                Matches are checked in order. If any match is successful, the
                rule is selected (OR semantics).    
                
                - `path` (optional)    
                    
                    - `match` (optional, enum)
                    
                        - `EXACT`
                    
                        - `PREFIX`
                    
                        - `REGEX`    
                    
                    - `value` (required)
                    
                        Value is the path to match against. For EXACT and PREFIX match
                        types, it must be a HTTP URI path. For the REGEX match type,
                        it must be a RE2 regular expression.
                        Note that a PREFIX match succeeds only if the prefix is the
                        the entire path or is followed by a /. I.e. a prefix of the
                        path in terms of path elements.

                        Backend denotes the service to which requests will be mirrored. The

                        - `weight` (required)
                        
                            Weight is the proportion of requests this backend will receive
                            when a forwarding rules specifies multiple backends. Traffic
                            weight is computed as "weight/sum(all weights)".
                            
                            A weight of 0 means that the destination will be ignored.

                        Percentage specifies the percentage of requests to mirror to
                        the backend (in the range 0.0 - 100.0, inclusive).

                        - the path "/prefix/rest" is rewritten to "/rest"    
            
            - `backends` (optional, repeated)
            
                Backends is the set of services to which the gateway will
                forward requests. If a redirect filter is specified, no
                backends are allowed. Otherwise, at least one backend
                must be given.    
                
                - `weight` (required)
                
                    Weight is the proportion of requests this backend will receive
                    when a forwarding rules specifies multiple backends. Traffic
                    weight is computed as "weight/sum(all weights)".
                    
                    A weight of 0 means that the destination will be ignored.

                    Destination is a selector to match the individual endpoints to
