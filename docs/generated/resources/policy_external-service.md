        - `enabled` (optional)
        
            denotes that the external service uses TLS    
        
        - `caCert` (optional)

        - `allowRenegotiation` (optional)
        
            If true then TLS session will allow renegotiation.
            It's not recommended to set this to true because of security reasons.
            However, some servers requires this setting, especially when using
            mTLS.    
        
        - `serverName` (optional)
        
            ServerName overrides the default Server Name Indicator set by Kuma.
            The default value is set to "address" specified in "networking".

- `tags` (required)

    Tags associated with the external service,
    e.g. kuma.io/service=web, kuma.io/protocol, version=1.0.
