### Checklist prior to review

<!--

If something doesn't apply please check the box and add a justification after the `--`
-->

- [ ] [Link to relevant issue][1] as well as docs and UI issues --
- [ ] This will not break child repos: it doesn't hardcode values (.e.g "kumahq" as a image registry) and it will work on Windows, system specific functions like `syscall.Mkfifo` have equivalent implementation on the other OS --
- [ ] Tests (Unit test, E2E tests, manual test on universal and k8s) --
- [ ] Do you need to update [`UPGRADE.md`](../blob/master/UPGRADE.md)? --
- [ ] Does it need to be backported according to the [backporting policy](../blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#backporting)? --
- [ ] Do you need to explicitly set a [`> Changelog:` entry here](../blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-patch) or add a `ci/` label to run fewer/more tests?
