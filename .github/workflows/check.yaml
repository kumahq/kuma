  # This job checks the PR title using
  # https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint
  # for the conventional commit format at
  # https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
  # See also /.github/commitlint.config.js for more details
  # We only need to check the PR title because it will end up being the
  # (default) commit title when doing squash merges with Github.
  # See
  # https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#merge-message-for-a-squash-merge
  # for more info. We have "Default to PR title for squash merge commits" enabled.
