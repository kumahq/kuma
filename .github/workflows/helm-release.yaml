# This workflow provides two things:
# On explicit dispatch, it packages, uploads and releases the chart to the
# charts repo.
#   It uses the appVersion and version as present in Chart.yaml.
# On push to master, it packages and uploads a helm chart for the pushed commit.
#   It updates both appVersion and version to be specific to this commit.
#   See tools/release/helm.sh#dev_version
# This workflow can be tested by any owner with a fork of kumahq/kuma and kumahq/charts
